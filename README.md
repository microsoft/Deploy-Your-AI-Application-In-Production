# Deploy your AI Application in Production

## Overview

This solution accelerator provides a foundation template for deploying a Project within AI Foundry into a secure, private, and protected landing zone within Azure. This zone will be established under Microsoft's Well-Architected Framework (WAF) to provide secure infrastructure for an AI Foundry Project intended to move from a Proof of Concept state to a production-ready application.

This template leverages Azure Verified Modules (AVM) and the Azure Developer CLI (AZD) to provision WAF-aligned infrastructure. This infrastructure includes AI Foundry elements, a virtual network (VNET), private endpoints, Key Vault, a storage account, and optional WAF-aligned resources (such as Cosmos DB and SQL Server) that can be leveraged with AI Foundry–developed projects.

## Architecture
The diagram below illustrates the capabilities included in the template.

![Network Isolation Infrastructure](./img/Architecture/Deploy-AI-App-in-Prod-Architecture_final.png)

| Diagram Step      | Description     |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| 1 | Tenant users utilize Microsoft Entra ID and multi-factor authentication to log in to the jumpbox virtual machine |
| 2 | Users and workloads within the client's virtual network can utilize private endpoints to access managed resources and the hub workspace|
| 3 | The workspace-managed virtual network is automatically generated for you when you configure managed network isolation to one of the following modes: <br> Allow Internet Outbound <br> Allow Only Approved Outbound|
| 4 | The online endpoint is secured with Microsoft Entra ID authentication. Client applications must obtain a security token from the Microsoft Entra ID tenant before invoking the prompt flow hosted by the managed deployment and available through the online endpoint|
| 5 | API Management creates consistent, modern API gateways for existing backend services. In this architecture, API Management is used in a fully private mode to offload cross-cutting concerns from the API code and hosts.|




## Key Features
### What solutions does this enable? 
- Deploy AI Foundry application into a secure environment 

- Connect the application to essential Azure services while adhering to the best practices outlined in the Well Architected Framework

- Provide the ability to select services to deploy that are relevant to the project  
  
## Prerequisites

1. Azure subscription and Entra ID account with Contributor permissions.
2. Install the [Azure Developer CLI (AZD)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/install-azd?tabs=winget-windows%2Cbrew-mac%2Cscript-linux&pivots=os-windows)
3. Validate [Required Roles and Scopes](Required_Roles_and_Scopes.md)
4. (Optional) [GitHub Codespaces deployment](DeployViaCodeSpaces.md) - requires the user to be on a GitHub Team or Enterprise Cloud plan

# Setup

### Clone Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/Deploy-Your-AI-Application-In-Production.git
cd Deploy-Your-AI-Application-In-Production
```

### Establish AZD Environment

This solution uses the [Azure Developer CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/overview) to quickly provision and deploy infrastructure and applications to Azure.

To get started, authenticate with an Azure Subscription ([details](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/reference#azd-auth-login)):

```powershell
azd auth login
```

Establish new environment. Provide a name that represents the application domain:

```powershell
azd env new '<app name>'
```

Optionally set environment variables via the following commands:

```powershell
azd env set 'AZURE_VM_ADMIN_PASSWORD' '<secure password>'
```

# Deploy

To provision the necessary Azure resources and deploy the application, run the azd up command:
```powershell
azd up
```
This will kick off an interactive console to provide required flags and parameters to deploy the infrastructure of a secure, WAF-aligned AI Foundry environment.



>- This deployment will take 15-20 minutes to provision the resources in your account. If you get an error or timeout with deployment, changing the location can help, as there may be availability constraints for the resources.
>- Note the `.env` file created at `/.azure/<app name>`. These are the environment configuration output from running the `azd up` command. These values are names of resources created as part of the baseline infrastructure.
